            <br>
            I have a desire to develop a personal website to showcase my work and skills, which can help me in job interviews and advancing my career. 
            But recently, I've discovered something more important in life. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Previously, I used to believe that in order to make a meaningful impact on the lives of the  underprivileged, 
            I had to be wealthy since many things in the world require money, not an action or idea can solve. 
            <br>
            <br>
            However, I have come to realize that by striving to become well-known and influential, 
            I can actively contribute to improving the lives of those in need.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Through my own experiences, I have learned the power for positive mindset. 
            It's all about having the right attitude and believing in yourself. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When you think positively, you can achieve great things. 
            That's why I no longer believe in the idea that larger expectations lead to larger disappointments. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="conclusion">
                Instead, I'm eager to embark on my journey by sharing the concept of Elysium, and I hope it will inspire others and bring them a sense of joy.
